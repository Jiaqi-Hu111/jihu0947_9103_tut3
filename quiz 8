My first repository for IDEA9103

This is my first change to the repo!


# **Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration**
## "MOSAIC CITY" (YOON HYUP)
My inspiration comes from the work of Korean artist YOON HYUP's  "MOSAIC CITY". This work is completely composed of lines and dots of different colors. Although the composition elements are very simple, the picture is very dynamic, and the night view of the city seems to be flowing with time. I want to integrate this fluid expression into my project, generate colorful dots and lines through p5.js, and add some interactive methods. This meets the requirement of our course to express the essence of art works through programming and has interactive fuctions.

# **Coding Technique Exploration**
## Perlin Noise
Perlin Noise can process images continuously and smoothly, and can generate a changing state of natual transition. This technique will help me process the dots and lines in the project, so that they can form a natual flow like water ripples, instead of sudden jumping. It can also show the dynamic visual effects contained in the original painting.
